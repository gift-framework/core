  GIFT Algebraic Foundations: Betti Numbers from Octonions
  ========================================================

  Phase 4 of the Octonion Formalization Plan.

  THIS IS THE KEY FILE: We derive the Betti numbers b₂ and b₃
  from the octonion structure, rather than defining them arbitrarily.

  Main results:
  - b₂ = C(|Im(𝕆)|, 2) = C(7,2) = 21
  - b₃ = 3 × b₂ + dim(G₂) = 3 × 21 + 14 = 77
  - H* = b₂ + b₃ + 1 = 99

  These are NOT arbitrary numbers - they DERIVE from:
  - The 7 imaginary units of 𝕆
  - The 14-dimensional automorphism group G₂

## b₂ from Octonion Structure

b₂ = C(7,2) = 21

This counts pairs of imaginary units in 𝕆.
Geometrically: 2-forms on a G₂ 7-manifold decompose into
Ω²₇ ⊕ Ω²₁₄ with dimensions 7 + 14 = 21.

## E₇ Fundamental Representation

The 56-dimensional fundamental representation of E₇ appears
in the derivation of b₃.

fund(E₇) = 56 = 2 × b₂ + dim(G₂) = 2 × 21 + 14

## b₃ from Octonion and G₂ Structure

b₃ = 3 × b₂ + dim(G₂) = 3 × 21 + 14 = 77

This formula encodes:
- 3 copies of b₂ (from triple structure in TCS construction)
- Plus the G₂ dimension (from holonomy)

Equivalently: b₃ = b₂ + fund(E₇)

## H* = Total Hodge Number

H* = b₂ + b₃ + 1 = 21 + 77 + 1 = 99

The "+1" comes from the trivial cohomology H⁰.

## Summary: Derivation Chain

ℍ → 𝕆 → G₂ → b₂, b₃ → GIFT

1. 𝕆 has 7 imaginary units (from Cayley-Dickson)
2. G₂ = Aut(𝕆) has dimension 14 = 2×7
3. b₂ = C(7,2) = 21 (pairs of imaginary units)
4. fund(E₇) = 56 = 2×21 + 14 (from E₇ representation theory)
5. b₃ = b₂ + fund(E₇) = 21 + 56 = 77
6. H* = b₂ + b₃ + 1 = 99

These are DERIVED from algebraic structure, not arbitrary inputs!
