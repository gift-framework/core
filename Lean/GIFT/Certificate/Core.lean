# GIFT Master Certificate

The single theorem proving GIFT is certified:
  Foundations ∧ Predictions ∧ Spectral

Structure:
- **Foundations**: E₈ root system, G₂ cross product, octonion bridge,
  K₇ topology, Hodge theory, Joyce existence, conformal rigidity
- **Predictions**: 33+ published dimensionless derivations, V5.0 observables,
  Fano selection, sector classification, hierarchy
- **Spectral**: Mass gap 14/99, TCS bounds, selection principle,
  Cheeger inequality, Yang-Mills, Connes bridge

Replaces the legacy monolithic Certificate.lean.

/-- GIFT Master Certificate: the entire framework is formally verified.

Three independent pillars:
1. **Foundations** — Mathematical infrastructure (E₈, G₂, octonions, K₇, Joyce)
2. **Predictions** — Published dimensionless relations and observables
3. **Spectral** — Spectral gap programme (mass gap, TCS, selection)
